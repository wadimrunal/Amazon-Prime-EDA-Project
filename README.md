# Conclusion
The analysis of the Amazon Prime dataset provided valuable insights into the platform’s overall content landscape. The dataset included rich information about movie categories, genres, age ratings, release years, and production countries. By studying these attributes, the project was able to identify clear patterns in how Amazon Prime’s content library has expanded and evolved over time. The release-year trend analysis showed noticeable growth in content production, highlighting specific years in which the platform increased its focus on adding new titles.
Additionally, the evaluation of IMDb and TMDB ratings helped assess the quality of content available on the platform. Through this, the analysis identified top-performing titles as well as directors with consistently high ratings. These insights are crucial for understanding user preferences and guiding future content decisions.
A major part of the project also involved cleaning the dataset. By removing duplicate records and handling missing values, the dataset became more accurate and reliable for analysis. This step ensured that the conclusions drawn from the project were dependable and based on high-quality data. Overall, the project successfully provided a deeper understanding of Amazon Prime’s content strategy and offered meaningful recommendations for improving viewer engagement, content diversity, and platform growth.
